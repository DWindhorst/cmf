## What is cmf?

cmf is a '''programming library''' to create '''hydrological models''',
which are highly modular and connectible to other models developed using
a [multiple hypotheses background](@ref CmfIntroduction). Although written
in C++, its primary usage is to be compiled as an extension to other
programming languages, using [SWIG](http://www.swig.org). Until now only
[Python](http://www.python.org) is actively supported to use the
SoftwareObjects of cmf to set up a scope dependend, specialized model.
cmf uses the FiniteVolumeMethod to set up a wide range of models of
water flow through your study area.

It is published as '''free software''' under
